This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

#### 1) Read and Process Data

```{r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(data.table)

webURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
destURL <- file.path(getwd(),paste("activity_monitoring_data",".zip",sep = ""))
localFileURL <- file.path(getwd(),paste("activity",".csv",sep = ""))
download.file(webURL,destfile = destURL)

unzip(destURL)
#activityData <- as.data.frame(read.csv(localFileURL))
activityData <- read.csv(localFileURL, quote = "\"",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
activityData$steps <- as.numeric(activityData$steps)
activityData$interval <- as.numeric(activityData$interval)
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date,format = "%Y-%m-%d")

```


#### 2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day




``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#   2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
activityDataAg <- aggregate(activityData$steps,list(activityData$date),sum)
names(activityDataAg) <- c("date","totalSteps")
#activityDataAg <- activityDataAg[complete.cases(activityDataAg),]
hist(activityDataAg$totalSteps, xlab = "TotalSteps", breaks = 10)
```

The total median steps are `r stepsMedian` and the mean for the total steps taken is `r stepsMean`

``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#3) Mean and median number of steps taken each day
stepSummary <- as.table(summary(activityDataAg$totalSteps))
stepsMedian <- stepSummary[3]
stepsMean <- stepSummary[4]
```


``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# 4) Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
# removed na's
actDataAg <- activityDataAg[complete.cases(activityDataAg),]
#activityTS= ts(rnorm(48), start=c(2293,6), frequency=1)
plot(actDataAg$date,actDataAg$totalSteps,type = "l", xlab = "date",ylab = "total steps")
```



The date with the most 5 interval steps is `r activity5min[which(activity5min$avgsteps == max(activity5min$avgsteps)),"date"]`. The number of steps on this day was `r activity5min[which(activity5min$avgsteps == max(activity5min$avgsteps)),"avgsteps"]`

``` {r include = TRUE,echo = TRUE}
# 5
activity5min <- activityData[which(activityData$interval == 5),]
activity5min <- aggregate(activity5min$steps,list(activity5min$date),mean)
names(activity5min) <- c("date","avgsteps")
activity5min <- activity5min[complete.cases(activity5min),]
plot(activity5min$date,activity5min$avgsteps,type = "l", xlab = "date", ylab = "5min Avg Steps")

```

######  6 Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing datas
There are `r  nrow(activityData[!complete.cases(activityData),])` days that have NA's

``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

#stepSummary <- as.table(summary(activityDataAg$totalSteps))
#rowsNA <- nrow(activityData[!complete.cases(activityData),])

```

The strategy to fill na's includes carrying forward last periods mean value. The dataset is aggregated to get the mean steps for each day. If a day is NA, then the value from previous day is utilized. The below script aggregates, sorts, the uses previous day mean value. The dataset created is "activityNAfill"

The data set before aggregation contains NA's for an entire day. So it is not possible to estimate at a daily level. So the mean from the previous day using locf function works well for the total average steps.

Comparing the two histrograms, there is no significant change, when the breaks are 10

``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#  6 Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

stepSummary <- as.table(summary(activityDataAg$totalSteps))

rowsNA <- nrow(activityData[!complete.cases(activityData),])

library(zoo)
activityMean <- aggregate(activityData$steps,list(activityData$date),mean)
names(activityMean) <- c("date","avgSteps")
actDataMean <- activityMean[complete.cases(activityMean),]
actDataMeanNA <- activityMean[!complete.cases(activityMean),]

activityNAfill <- na.locf(activityMean[order(activityMean$date, decreasing = TRUE),], fromLast = TRUE)
activityNAfill <- activityNAfill[order(activityNAfill$date,decreasing = FALSE),]

activityNAfill$avgSteps <- as.numeric(activityNAfill$avgSteps)
activityNAfill$date <- as.Date(activityNAfill$date,format = "%Y-%m-%d")
hist(activityNAfill$avgSteps, xlab = "MeanSteps", breaks = 10)
```

``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
activityDataMean <- aggregate(activityData$steps,list(activityData$date),mean)
names(activityDataMean) <- c("date","meanSteps")
hist(activityDataMean$meanSteps, xlab = "Mean Steps with NA", breaks = 10)
```
